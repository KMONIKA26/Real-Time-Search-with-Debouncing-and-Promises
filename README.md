# Real-time Search with Debouncing and Promises

A simple web app that fetches and displays search results in real-time. It uses debouncing to minimize API calls and Promises to simulate a delayed API response. Includes a responsive navbar.

## Features

- **Real-time Search**: Updates results as you type.
- **Debouncing**: Triggers API calls only after 500ms of inactivity.
- **Simulated API**: Uses Promises with a 1-second delay for response.
- **Responsive Navbar**: Adapts to mobile and desktop views with a hamburger menu.
